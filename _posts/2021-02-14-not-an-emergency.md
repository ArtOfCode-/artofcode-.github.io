I've [written before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-02-13-999-misconceptions %}) about public misconceptions when
calling 999. I had planned to touch on this there, but there's enough nuance and detail that it deserves its own post.

When you call an ambulance, your call is triaged based on your current condition. If it's not critical, an ambulance
may not be sent &mdash; instead, you'll be directed to contact 111 for further assessment or advice, or to talk to your
GP or make your own way to hospital. This can sometimes come across as though the operators at 999, or the ambulance
service in general, doesn't care about your problem; the reality is exactly the opposite.

## Critical, Emergency, Urgent
These are terms used fairly frequently in the ambulance service that, on the surface, appear to mean the same or similar
thing. They're actually well-defined levels of urgency, depending on how life-threatening the call is.

 * _Critical_ (Category 1) calls are those where the patient's life is in immediate danger &mdash; the patient may be
   not breathing, or choking, or drowning.
 * _Emergency_ (mostly Category 2) calls still involve a risk to the patient's life in the near future. This could be
   something like a heart attack or a stroke.
 * _Urgent_ (usually Category 3 or 4) calls are those needing usually same-day treatment, but where there is no
   _immediate_ threat to life. Most broken bones and dislocations go here, along with mild breathing difficulties.

There are also _Non-Emergency_ calls, which are those where the patient could safely make their own way to a hospital,
just needs some advice, or would be better served by accessing care elsewhere.

As a service, obviously we respond to critical and emergency calls as soon as we possibly can. Critical calls will
usually need more than one crew dispatched to deal with them. This leaves urgent calls in a bit of an odd position
&mdash; they're not _not_ our responsibility, but clearly we have to respond to the more serious calls first. What
happens when all our crews are already engaged on jobs? Beyond that, there's non-emergency &mdash; sure, if we had the
crews, we'd send ambulances to these calls too, but the reality is that even if we tried to send to these calls, the
patients would be waiting significant lengths of time for anyone to get there. Particularly on the lower-category calls,
it's not rare to see an ambulance assigned and en-route, but then redirected halfway there to a more serious call
nearby.

## Urgent Care
For critical and emergency situations, the right option is clearly to call an ambulance. They'll get to you faster than 
you can get to hospital, and they can start life-saving care on board en route. For calls for urgent care, it's a bit
more fuzzy: yes, we'll get to you, but you may be waiting a little while. How long, exactly, depends on how busy
we are &mdash; a month ago, we had Category 3 calls waiting for 12 hours and more, although at the moment we're mostly
getting to them inside an hour.

This is where we rely on the public making a judgement for themselves: can the patient get to hospital (with assistance,
if necessary)? Is there someone who could take them, or could they get in a taxi? Or would it not be safe to move them,
or there's no other way of getting there, or do they need treatment where they are?

## Non-Emergency
Category 5 is where the misunderstandings and miscommunications start to crop up. Lots of aches, pains, and chronic
conditions end up falling into this category &mdash; back pain, abdominal pain, minor bleeding and burns, and lots of 
long-term medical conditions. Unless there are other more concerning symptoms present to make the call a higher 
priority, these callers are directed to 111, to a GP, or to make their own way to hospital.

These situations aren't life-threatening, but they can be debilitating, painful, and dehumanising, and having a 999
operator tell you that you're not going to get an ambulance can add to the frustration and upset. The common refrain to
being referred to 111 is "but they're in agony here!" Trust me, I know. I don't _want_ the patient to be in agony, or
unable to move, but my hands are tied.

This is twofold: firstly, I don't have a choice. As I've mentioned before, I'm following a protocol, and that protocol
dictates the priority assigned to the call; I don't get to choose who gets an ambulance. Secondly and more importantly,
we as a service know that if we tried to send you an ambulance, you'd be waiting for hours and hours in the same 
condition. We're sending you to 111 or to hospital not to say "this isn't a problem", but because you'll get help much
more quickly there.

When you call 111, you're connected to a health advisor. This operator can assess your condition in much more detail
than I can at 999. They can access your medical records. They can connect you to healthcare professionals &mdash;
doctors, nurses, mental health professionals, specialists. They can arrange emergency appointments for you. And, in the
worst case, if their detailed assessment reveals something that _does_ mean an ambulance should be sent as a precaution,
they can arrange that for you automatically, without having to send you back to 999.

We're always working on ways to improve the communication and experience around that. If you do call 999 and get
referred to 111, remember: we're _not_ saying this isn't a problem, we're just trying to get you help in the quickest
way possible.
