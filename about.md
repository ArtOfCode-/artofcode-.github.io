I'm Art. I'm an ambulance 999 operator and part-time programmer from the UK. If I'm not at work taking 999 calls, I can
often be found working on [Codidact](https://codidact.com), building open-source, Q&A-based, community-run
knowledge-sharing sites.

Please keep in mind that what I write here is my own opinion and experience. It's not necessarily reflective of my
my employer's position, unless I've _clearly_ stated otherwise
