The recent [disappearance][1], later [confirmed][2] to be abduction and murder, of Sarah Everard in London has thrown
me. It threw me early on, just after she'd been reported missing, before anyone knew it was a murder; the confirmation
that it was murder (and by a serving police officer, no less) only made things worse. I don't really know why &mdash;
there's nothing really unusual about this case (other than the serving-police-officer thing, but even that's not
unheard of) &mdash; but much of the UK seems to be feeling something similar.

Fair warning: this is just my reaction to all of this. This is what I've been feeling. I cannot _imagine_ what those
close to her are going through, and this is not to diminish any of that &mdash; I just wanted to get this out somewhere,
and this little-read blog that I write for my own benefit more than anyone else's seemed like a good place.
