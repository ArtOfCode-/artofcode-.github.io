I sit down and check each screen  
Set up my desk, log in, go "green".<!-- end_excerpt -->  
Wonder what the next call will be...  
Wonder what they'll say to me?  
Answer, talk, hang up, go green&mdash;  
Sometimes there's no time between.  
This one's screaming&mdash;now someone's died  
Overdose, hanging, suicide  
Car crash, stabbing, now a gunshot  
Choking, drowning&mdash;we get the lot.  
My voice, though, is calm and steady:  
To help you while the crew get ready.  
I'm right there with you on the line,  
Through this horrific life-changing time.  
Sometimes, I can't help at all&mdash;  
Yours aren't the only tears that fall.  
I often wish I could do more  
Because it's YOU I do this for.  
When we hang up, I was just a voice...  
Will you remember me? I'll have no choice&mdash;  
I'll always remember hearing your scream.

Answer. Talk. Hang up. Go Green.
