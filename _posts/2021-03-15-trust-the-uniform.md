The recent [disappearance][1], later [confirmed][2] to be abduction and murder, of Sarah Everard in London has thrown
me. It threw me early on, just after she'd been reported missing, before anyone knew it was a murder; the confirmation
that it was murder (and that the suspect is a serving police officer, no less) only made things worse. I don't really
know why &mdash; there's nothing really unusual about this case (other than the serving-police-officer thing, but even
that's not unheard of) &mdash; but much of the UK seems to be feeling something similar.

Fair warning: this is just my reaction to all of this. This is what I've been feeling. I cannot _imagine_ what those
close to her are going through, and this is not to diminish any of that &mdash; I just wanted to get this out somewhere,
and this little-read blog that I write for my own benefit more than anyone else's seemed like a good place.

## Safety
Now and then, when it's piddling with rain, or I'm tired, or have lots of stuff to take, I'll take an Uber in to work.
I got out of my Uber this morning and posted [this][3]:

> It's 0530. I've just got out of an Uber, that I got into on my own, in the dark, with minimal precautions, and felt
> confident that I was safe all the way.
>
> I feel... not guilty, but disappointed in myself that I haven't been more aware of this. I am now, though.

Twitter is never a great place to post about complex things because it's so restrictive, but I got the essence of it
there. It's not guilt; I have nothing to be guilty over. Disappointment in myself? Slight sense of shock at the scale
of this that I hadn't realised? Disgust that men* don't seem to care enough about doing something so women are left
picking up the pieces? Absolutely.

I can do that. I can get an Uber alone and be 99.9% sure I'll arrive safe at the other end. I can walk around the city
in the dark and be reasonably confident of not being attacked &mdash; or at least that I might stand a fighting chance
if I am. I can exist, in public, and not get catcalled, or raped, or murdered. And half the population (or 97% of half,
according to the number that I've seen going around) can't? What the fuck, men? How is this just... accepted?

It's not that I _didn't_ know about this, either. Offering to walk a friend home, or through the park, or checking in to
make sure they got home safe, is second nature &mdash; though whether it _should_ be or not is a whole other question.
The nationwide outrage at this particular happening &mdash; and the threads of women posting the endless lists of male
harassment and violence &mdash; has just brought it home just how endemic this really is.

## #999Family
Emergency services &mdash; certainly in the UK, likely the world over &mdash; work in very close proximity and harmony
to each other. In the UK, we have specific protocols to help agencies work together more effectively, and inter-agency
training is common. So are "blue light families": grandad was a firefighter, dad's followed his footsteps, mum's a
police officer, and there's a kid in the ambulance service. Even outside of blood-related families, there's a _very_
strong sense of shared experience, bonding, and family built up by working the kind of stressful environments that come
up in the emergency services. It's families all the way down: my watch-family, my control-room-family, my
service-family, my green-family, my national, emergency-services, all-together family. It's genuinely one of the best
things about working in the emergency services.

Families have feuds. They fall out. There are rivalries. There are tensions (some of the comments that go over the
linked systems to our local police... are best left unpublished). There's banter, there's fun, but there's also drama
and crises &mdash; and very occasionally, someone does something so unforgivable that they're disowned entirely.

There's a lot of nuance and lots of odd little dynamics in our big dysfunctional family, but to the public it's often
the impression that a single brush paints us all.
