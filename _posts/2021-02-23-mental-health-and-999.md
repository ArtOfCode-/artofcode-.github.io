Mental health is often spoken about as though it's one cohesive, neatly-packaged topic, in the same way that a physical
illness like "breathing difficulties" might be. When mental health and ambulance services end up on the news, the
common refrain is that "mental health calls to 999 are on the rise". Which... is not _wrong_, but it's like saying
"calls to 999 for medical conditions are on the rise" &mdash; it's not specific enough to talk about such a broad topic.
What kind of medical conditions? What kind of mental health conditions?

That being said, calls to 999 for mental health conditions and crises _are_ on the rise, and have been for some years.
The stigma around mental health has fallen &mdash; don't get me wrong, mental health is still stigmatised, but nowhere
_near_ as much as it used to be &mdash; and as it has, people have felt more confident to call for help when they're in
a mental health crisis. Which is a great start, but what hasn't yet caught up is the support services that _aren't_
999 &mdash; what's the equivalent of an urgent care centre for mental health? Can you name your nearest?

## What is an Emergency?
* medical/trauma relatively easy to define
* mental not so much
* disbelief by public and HCPs



* funding
* support
* wider system care, post-emergency support, rehabilitation etc etc
